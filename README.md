# AllStarLink-Display
The is a script I modified from one of the LUMA examples to drive an OLED display on an AllStarLink node.

It cycles through the following:
- ASL Logo
- Linux details, hostname, time, IP address, CPU temp.
- ASL connected nodes

The script is very simple and easy to extend if you desire.
